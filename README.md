# Web scrapping

This repository contains the code for scrapping information from a website. All the analyses are based on http://www.carehome.co.uk. The goal of this mini project consists of obtaining a list of the care home groups in England, their types of care homes and their type of ownership. The repository only contains the code used `care homes groups.R`
